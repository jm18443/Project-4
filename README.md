 ## Project-4 Machine Learning Integration
 
 Project Description

The World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardiovascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using Machine Learning.

Objective and execution methodology:

Our main objective is to create a front-end interface that maps to dataset/api and use smart alogorithm like k-nearest. Perform deepdive analysis using supervised ML. Train and test the data using mock data and simulate using machine learning. perform analysis of existing data to make prediction, classification and regression. 

Also create visulaization that continues to learn through clusters and will be able to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.

Analytics/Predictions of this project execution

 Train and test the data to make below predictions.

1- Does heart disease affect physical or mental health more?

2- Does smoking influence contracting heart disease at younger vs older age?

3- Predict which age group is prone to Heart Disease

4- Analyze the data to see if BMI and DiffWalking are correlated. Are they independent variables or is there a relationship between the BMI and difficulty walking for people with/without heart disease?

5- Impact of Behavioral risk factors to diseases - heart disease
